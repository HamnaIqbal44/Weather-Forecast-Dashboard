# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard
## 🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard
An interactive web application built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, designed to visualize weather data collected from multiple areas within **Pak-Austria Fachhochschule Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (PAF-IAST)**.
The system demonstrates the use of **data visualization and machine learning foundations** for analyzing temperature variations through engaging and informative dashboards.

## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to represent temperature data gathered from environmental sensors in an intuitive and analytical way. It allows users to explore, compare, and interpret weather conditions across different campus locations using **interactive charts** and **CSV-based data integration**.

## 🧠 Key Features
1. 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** – Displays temperature data in charts and tables.
2. 🧩 **Multiple Visualization Modes** – Users can navigate between Dashboard, Pie Chart, Bar Chart, and Area views.
3. 🌍 **Area-Based Analysis** – Temperature readings categorized by campus zones:
         a. SPCAI
         b. A2 Block
         c. STC
         d. Hostel
5. 📈 **CSV Data Processing** – Reads data from CSV files and visualizes results dynamically.
6. 🧭 **User-Friendly Navigation** – Sidebar with navigation tabs for effortless exploration.

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:**
   Temperature readings are collected through sensors installed in four university areas.

2. **Data Storage:**
   The readings are stored in a structured CSV file, containing records of temperature values for each area.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   Using **Streamlit** and **Pandas**, the dashboard processes the CSV data and presents it through:

   1. Bar charts for area-wise comparisons
   2. Pie charts for distribution analysis
   3. Dashboard summary for overall insights

4. **Analysis:**
   Users can easily identify temperature variations and compare readings across all areas.
